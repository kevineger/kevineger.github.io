The service is for schools and institutions to better market their classes and provide the general public with a central hub for discovering them. The service operates through two mediums: a website and mobile app. This was a group project for Capstone, I took on building the bulk of our web app and the API (for mobile consumers).

Honours thesis geared towards developing a one-stop-shop for data analysis and resources for interpreting Reddit. The main deliverable for this project was developing a web app where the general public can easily access all the data and metrics they could hope for pertaining to Reddit. A user is also able to view the hierarchical clustering of subreddits dynamically - allowing easy detection of bi-partisan communities.

RallySearch is an alternative way of consuming Reddit. As Redditors all know, search functionality within the site is rather lackluster. This prototype project aims to offer an alternative to browsing Reddit by it's content in a visually pleasing and simple fashion. Top media posts on Reddit are sent through Google's [_Cloud Vision_](https://cloud.google.com/vision) and results are cached. Upon giving each image (or preview in the case of videos and gifs) labels, users can easily view similar content by selecting the desired tag(s).

Instagram Visualizer is a desktop application designed for visualizing a user's Instagram networks. The software supports several node and graph based metrics and multiple visual layouts. Instagram Visualizer uses several external libraries where possible such as Cytoscape for visualizing and AngularJS. The software relies upon [Instawrapper](https://github.com/Jakedavies/instawrapper), a standalone package available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~instawrapper) for interacting with the Instagram API with ease. On top of visualizing, the software can export graphML files so that further analysis may be carried out using industry-grade software such as Yed or NodeXL.

MyUniTrade was a student-to-student textbook exchange site which launched January 10th, 2015 at UofC. It was founded by two friends who are students at the University of Calgary pursuing business degrees, a friend/peer at UBCO and myself. My responsibilities for the site lay primarily on user interaction. I took care of the front-end. The service generated quite a large amount of traffic, peaking at over 1000 hits a day.
